## Matrix2png

http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/matrix2png/

> This program converts tab-delmited matrix files into png images. It is implemented in ANSI C and utilized Tom Boutell's gd library (which in turn uses libpng and zlib). It is designed to be called from the command line or within a script.

## Heatmap from HIV sequence database

http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HEATMAP/heatmap.html

> A heatmap is a graphical way of displaying a table of numbers by using colors to represent the numerical values. The clustering algorithm groups related rows and/or columns together by similarity.
